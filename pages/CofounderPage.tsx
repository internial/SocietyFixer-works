                    I started SocietyFixer with a simple but powerful mission: to fix the broken political system by focusing on policy, not fundraising. Right now, we are focused on this single feature for the USA, as we are limited by manpower. However, our long-term vision is to build many more features that make the U.S. government and its allies more effective and efficient, and to expand our platform to America's trusted democratic allies. A mission this big can't be accomplished alone. I'm looking for two passionate, driven technical cofounders to join me on this journey.
